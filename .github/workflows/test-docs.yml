# This is a GitHub workflow defining a set of jobs with a set of steps.
# ref: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

# This workflow validates the REST API definition and runs the pytest tests in
# the docs/ folder. This workflow does not build the documentation. That is
# instead tested via ReadTheDocs (https://readthedocs.org/projects/jupyterhub/).

name: Test docs

# The tests defined in docs/ are currently influenced by changes to _version.py
