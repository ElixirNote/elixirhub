# Spawners

A [Spawner][] starts each single-user notebook server.
The Spawner represents an abstract interface to a process,
and a custom Spawner needs to be able to take three actions:

- start the process
- poll whether the process is still running
- stop the process

## Examples

Custom Spawners for JupyterHub can be found on the [JupyterHub wiki](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/wiki/Spawners).
Some examples include:

- [DockerSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner) for spawning user servers in Docker containers
  - `dockerspawner.DockerSpawner` for spawning identical Docker containers for
    each users
  - `dockerspawner.SystemUserSpawner` for spawning Docker containers with an
    environment and home directory for each users
  - both `DockerSpawner` and `SystemUserSpawner` also work with Docker Swarm for
    launching containers on remote machines
- [SudoSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/sudospawner) enables JupyterHub to
  run without being root, by spawning an intermediate process via `sudo`
- [BatchSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner) for spawning remote
  servers using batch systems
- [YarnSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/yarnspawner) for spawning notebook
  servers in YARN containers on a Hadoop cluster
- [SSHSpawner](https://github.com/NERSC/sshspawner) to spawn notebooks
  on a remote server using SSH

## Spawner control methods

### Spawner.start

`Spawner.start` should start the single-user server for a single user.
Information about the user can be retrieved from `self.user`,
an object encapsulating the user's name, authentication, and server info.

The return value of `Spawner.start` should be the `(ip, port)` of the running server,
or a full URL as a string.

Most `Spawner.start` functions will look similar to this example:

```python
async def start(self):
    self.ip = '127.0.0.1'
    self.port = random_port()
    # get environment variables,
    # several of which are required for configuring the single-user server
    env = self.get_env()
    cmd = []
    # get jupyterhub command to run,
    # typically ['jupyterhub-singleuser']
    cmd.extend(self.cmd)
    cmd.extend(self.get_args())

    await self._actually_start_server_somehow(cmd, env)
    # url may not match self.ip:self.port, but it could!
    url = self._get_connectable_url()
    return url
```

When `Spawner.start` returns, the single-user server process should actually be running,
not just requested. JupyterHub can handle `Spawner.start` being very slow
(such as PBS-style batch queues, or instantiating whole AWS instances)
via relaxing the `Spawner.start_timeout` config value.

#### Note on IPs and ports

`Spawner.ip` and `Spawner.port` attributes set the _bind_ url,
which the single-user server should listen on
(passed to the single-user process via the `JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_URL` environment variable).
The _return_ value is the ip and port (or full url) the Hub should _connect to_.
These are not necessarily the same, and usually won't be in any Spawner that works with remote resources or containers.

The default for Spawner.ip, and Spawner.port is `127.0.0.1:{random}`,
which is appropriate for Spawners that launch local processes,
where everything is on localhost and each server needs its own port.
For remote or container Spawners, it will often make sense to use a different value,
such as `ip = '0.0.0.0'` and a fixed port, e.g. `8888`.
The defaults can be changed in the class,
preserving configuration with traitlets:

```python
from traitlets import default
from jupyterhub.spawner import Spawner

class MySpawner(Spawner):
    @default("ip")
    def _default_ip(self):
        return '0.0.0.0'

    @default("port")
    def _default_port(self):
        return 8888

    async def start(self):
        env = self.get_env()
        cmd = []
        # get jupyterhub command to run,
        # typically ['jupyterhub-singleuser']
        cmd.extend(self.cmd)
        cmd.extend(self.get_args())

        remote_server_info = await self._actually_start_server_somehow(cmd, env)
        url = self.get_public_url_from(remote_server_info)
        return url
```

#### Exception handling

When `Spawner.start` raises an Exception, a message can be passed on to the user via the exception via a `.jupyterhub_html_message` or `.jupyterhub_message` attribute.

When the Exception has a `.jupyterhub_html_message` attribute, it will be rendered as HTML to the user.

Alternatively `.jupyterhub_message` is rendered as unformatted text.

If both attributes are not present, the Exception will be shown to the user as unformatted text.

### Spawner.poll

`Spawner.poll` should check if the spawner is still running.
It should return `None` if it is still running,
and an integer exit status, otherwise.

For the local process case, `Spawner.poll` uses `os.kill(PID, 0)`
to check if the local process is still running. On Windows, it uses `psutil.pid_exists`.

### Spawner.stop

`Spawner.stop` should stop the process. It must be a tornado coroutine, which should return when the process has finished exiting.

## Spawner state

JupyterHub should be able to stop and restart without tearing down
single-user notebook servers. To do this task, a Spawner may need to persist
some information that can be restored later.
A JSON-able dictionary of state can be used to store persisted information.

Unlike start, stop, and poll methods, the state methods must not be coroutines.

For the single-process case, the Spawner state is only the process ID of the server:

```python
def get_state(self):
    """get the current state"""
    state = super().get_state()
    if self.pid:
        state['pid'] = self.pid
    return state

def load_state(self, state):
    """load state from the database"""
    super().load_state(state)
    if 'pid' in state:
        self.pid = state['pid']

def clear_state(self):
    """clear any state (called after shutdown)"""
    super().clear_state()
    self.pid = 0
```

## Spawner options form

(new in 0.4)

Some deployments may want to offer options to users to influence how their servers are started.
This may include cluster-based deployments, where users specify what resources should be available,
or docker-based deployments where users can select from a list of base images.

This feature is enabled by setting `Spawner.options_form`, which is an HTML form snippet
inserted unmodified into the spawn form.
If the `Spawner.options_form` is defined, when a user tries to start their server, they will be directed to a form page, like this:

![spawn-form](../images/spawn-form.png)

If `Spawner.options_form` is undefined, the user's server is spawned directly, and no spawn page is rendered.

See [this example](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/blob/HEAD/examples/spawn-form/jupyterhub_config.py) for a form that allows custom CLI args for the local spawner.

### `Spawner.options_from_form`

Options from this form will always be a dictionary of lists of strings, e.g.:

```python
{
  'integer': ['5'],
  'text': ['some text'],
  'select': ['a', 'b'],
}
```

When `formdata` arrives, it is passed through `Spawner.options_from_form(formdata)`,
which is a method to turn the form data into the correct structure.
This method must return a dictionary, and is meant to interpret the lists-of-strings into the correct types. For example, the `options_from_form` for the above form would look like:

```python
def options_from_form(self, formdata):
    options = {}
    options['integer'] = int(formdata['integer'][0]) # single integer value
    options['text'] = formdata['text'][0] # single string value
    options['select'] = formdata['select'] # list already correct
    options['notinform'] = 'extra info' # not in the form at all
    return options
```

which would return:

```python
{
  'integer': 5,
  'text': 'some text',
  'select': ['a', 'b'],
  'notinform': 'extra info',
}
```

When `Spawner.start` is called, this dictionary is accessible as `self.user_options`.

## Writing a custom spawner

If you are interested in building a custom spawner, you can read [this tutorial](http://jupyterhub-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spawners.html).

### Registering custom Spawners via entry points

As of JupyterHub 1.0, custom Spawners can register themselves via
the `jupyterhub.spawners` entry point metadata.
To do this, in your `setup.py` add:

```python
setup(
  ...
  entry_points={
    'jupyterhub.spawners': [
        'myservice = mypackage:MySpawner',
    ],
  },
)
```

If you have added this metadata to your package,
users can select your spawner with the configuration:

```python
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'myservice'
```

instead of the full

```python
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'mypackage:MySpawner'
```

previously required.
Additionally, configurable attributes for your spawner will
appear in jupyterhub help output and auto-generated configuration files
via `jupyterhub --generate-config`.

## Environment variables and command-line arguments

Spawners mainly do one thing: launch a command in an environment.

The command-line is constructed from user configuration:

- Spawner.cmd (default: `['jupterhub-singleuser']`)
- Spawner.args (cli args to pass to the cmd, default: empty)

where the configuration:

```python
c.Spawner.cmd = ["my-singleuser-wrapper"]
c.Spawner.args = ["--debug", "--flag"]
```

would result in spawning the command:

```bash
my-singleuser-wrapper --debug --flag
```

The `Spawner.get_args()` method is how Spawner.args is accessed,
and can be used by Spawners to customize/extend user-provided arguments.

Prior to 2.0, JupyterHub unconditionally added certain options _if specified_ to the command-line,
such as `--ip={Spawner.ip}` and `--port={Spawner.port}`.
These have now all been moved to environment variables,
and from JupyterHub 2.0,
the command-line launched by JupyterHub is fully specified by overridable configuration `Spawner.cmd + Spawner.args`.

Most process configuration is passed via environment variables.
Additional variables can be specified via the `Spawner.environment` configuration.

The process environment is returned by `Spawner.get_env`, which specifies the following environment variables:

- JUPYTERHUB*SERVICE_URL - the \_bind* url where the server should launch its http server (`http://127.0.0.1:12345`).
  This includes Spawner.ip and Spawner.port; _new in 2.0, prior to 2.0 ip,port were on the command-line and only if specified_
- JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX - the URL prefix the service will run on (e.g. `/user/name/`)
- JUPYTERHUB_USER - the JupyterHub user's username
- JUPYTERHUB_SERVER_NAME - the server's name, if using named servers (default server has an empty name)
- JUPYTERHUB_API_URL - the full url for the JupyterHub API (http://17.0.0.1:8001/hub/api)
- JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL - the base url of the whole jupyterhub deployment, i.e. the bit before `hub/` or `user/`,
  as set by c.JupyterHub.base_url (default: `/`)
- JUPYTERHUB_API_TOKEN - the API token the server can use to make requests to the Hub.
  This is also the OAuth client secret.
- JUPYTERHUB_CLIENT_ID - the OAuth client ID for authenticating visitors.
- JUPYTERHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL - the callback URL to use in oauth, typically `/user/:name/oauth_callback`

Optional environment variables, depending on configuration:

- JUPYTERHUB*SSL*[KEYFILE|CERTFILE|CLIENT_CI] - SSL configuration, when internal_ssl is enabled
- JUPYTERHUB_ROOT_DIR - the root directory of the server (notebook directory), when Spawner.notebook_dir is defined (new in 2.0)
- JUPYTERHUB_DEFAULT_URL - the default URL for the server (for redirects from /user/:name/),
  if Spawner.default_url is defined
  (new in 2.0, previously passed via cli)
- JUPYTERHUB_DEBUG=1 - generic debug flag, sets maximum log level when Spawner.debug is True
  (new in 2.0, previously passed via cli)
- JUPYTERHUB_DISABLE_USER_CONFIG=1 - disable loading user config,
  sets maximum log level when Spawner.debug is True (new in 2.0,
  previously passed via cli)

- JUPYTERHUB*[MEM|CPU]*[LIMIT_GUARANTEE] - the values of cpu and memory limits and guarantees.
  These are not expected to be enforced by the process,
  but are made available as a hint,
  e.g. for resource monitoring extensions.

## Spawners, resource limits, and guarantees (Optional)

Some spawners of the single-user notebook servers allow setting limits or
guarantees on resources, such as CPU and memory. To provide a consistent
experience for sysadmins and users, we provide a standard way to set and
discover these resource limits and guarantees, such as for memory and CPU.
For the limits and guarantees to be useful, **the spawner must implement
support for them**. For example, LocalProcessSpawner, the default
spawner, does not support limits and guarantees. One of the spawners
that supports limits and guarantees is the `systemdspawner`.

### Memory Limits & Guarantees

`c.Spawner.mem_limit`: A **limit** specifies the _maximum amount of memory_
that may be allocated, though there is no promise that the maximum amount will
be available. In supported spawners, you can set `c.Spawner.mem_limit` to
limit the total amount of memory that a single-user notebook server can
allocate. Attempting to use more memory than this limit will cause errors. The
single-user notebook server can discover its own memory limit by looking at
the environment variable `MEM_LIMIT`, which is specified in absolute bytes.

`c.Spawner.mem_guarantee`: Sometimes, a **guarantee** of a _minimum amount of
memory_ is desirable. In this case, you can set `c.Spawner.mem_guarantee` to
to provide a guarantee that at minimum this much memory will always be
available for the single-user notebook server to use. The environment variable
`MEM_GUARANTEE` will also be set in the single-user notebook server.

**The spawner's underlying system or cluster is responsible for enforcing these
limits and providing these guarantees.** If these values are set to `None`, no
limits or guarantees are provided, and no environment values are set.

### CPU Limits & Guarantees

`c.Spawner.cpu_limit`: In supported spawners, you can set
`c.Spawner.cpu_limit` to limit the total number of cpu-cores that a
single-user notebook server can use. These can be fractional - `0.5` means 50%
of one CPU core, `4.0` is 4 cpu-cores, etc. This value is also set in the
single-user notebook server's environment variable `CPU_LIMIT`. The limit does
not claim that you will be able to use all the CPU up to your limit as other
higher priority applications might be taking up CPU.

`c.Spawner.cpu_guarantee`: You can set `c.Spawner.cpu_guarantee` to provide a
guarantee for CPU usage. The environment variable `CPU_GUARANTEE` will be set
in the single-user notebook server when a guarantee is being provided.

**The spawner's underlying system or cluster is responsible for enforcing these
limits and providing these guarantees.** If these values are set to `None`, no
limits or guarantees are provided, and no environment values are set.

### Encryption

Communication between the `Proxy`, `Hub`, and `Notebook` can be secured by
turning on `internal_ssl` in `jupyterhub_config.py`. For a custom spawner to
utilize these certs, there are two methods of interest on the base `Spawner`
class: `.create_certs` and `.move_certs`.

The first method, `.create_certs` will sign a key-cert pair using an internally
trusted authority for notebooks. During this process, `.create_certs` can
apply `ip` and `dns` name information to the cert via an `alt_names` `kwarg`.
This is used for certificate authentication (verification). Without proper
verification, the `Notebook` will be unable to communicate with the `Hub` and
vice versa when `internal_ssl` is enabled. For example, given a deployment
using the `DockerSpawner` which will start containers with `ips` from the
`docker` subnet pool, the `DockerSpawner` would need to instead choose a
container `ip` prior to starting and pass that to `.create_certs` (TODO: edit).

In general though, this method will not need to be changed and the default
`ip`/`dns` (localhost) info will suffice.

When `.create_certs` is run, it will `.create_certs` in a default, central
location specified by `c.JupyterHub.internal_certs_location`. For `Spawners`
that need access to these certs elsewhere (i.e. on another host altogether),
the `.move_certs` method can be overridden to move the certs appropriately.
Again, using `DockerSpawner` as an example, this would entail moving certs
to a directory that will get mounted into the container this spawner starts.
