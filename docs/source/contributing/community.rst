Community communication channels
================================

We use `Discourse <https://discourse.jupyter.org>` for online discussion.
Everyone in the Jupyter community is welcome to bring ideas and questions there.
In addition, we use `Gitter <https://gitter.im>`_ for online, real-time text chat,
a place for more ephemeral discussions.
The primary Gitter channel for JupyterHub is `jupyterhub/jupyterhub <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_.
Gitter isn't archived or searchable, so we recommend going to discourse first
to make sure that discussions are most useful and accessible to the community.
Remember that our community is distributed across the world in various
timezones, so be patient if you do not get an answer immediately!

GitHub issues are used for most long-form project discussions, bug reports
and feature requests. Issues related to a specific authenticator or
spawner should be directed to the appropriate repository for the
authenticator or spawner. If you are using a specific JupyterHub
distribution (such as `Zero to JupyterHub on Kubernetes <http://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s>`_
or `The Littlest JupyterHub <http://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/>`_),
you should open issues directly in their repository. If you can not
find a repository to open your issue in, do not worry! Create it in the `main
JupyterHub repository <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/>`_ and our
community will help you figure it out.

A `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter>`_ for all
of Project Jupyter exists, along with one for `teaching with Jupyter
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter-education>`_.
