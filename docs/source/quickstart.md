# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

Before installing JupyterHub, you will need:

- a Linux/Unix based system
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or greater. An understanding
  of using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io) or
  [`conda`](https://conda.io/docs/get-started.html) for
  installing Python packages is helpful.
- [nodejs/npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). [Install nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node),
  using your operating system's package manager.

  - If you are using **`conda`**, the nodejs and npm dependencies will be installed for
    you by conda.

  - If you are using **`pip`**, install a recent version of
    [nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
    For example, install it on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) using:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    ```

    [nodesource][] is a great resource to get more recent versions of the nodejs runtime,
    if your system package manager only has an old version of Node.js (e.g. 10 or older).

- A [pluggable authentication module (PAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module)
  to use the [default Authenticator](./getting-started/authenticators-users-basics.md).
  PAM is often available by default on most distributions, if this is not the case it can be installed by
  using the operating system's package manager.
- TLS certificate and key for HTTPS communication
- Domain name

Before running the single-user notebook servers (which may be on the same
system as the Hub or not), you will need:

- [JupyterLab][] version 3 or greater,
  or [Jupyter Notebook][]
  4 or greater.

[jupyter notebook]: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

## Installation

JupyterHub can be installed with `pip` (and the proxy with `npm`) or `conda`:

**pip, npm:**

```bash
python3 -m pip install jupyterhub
npm install -g configurable-http-proxy
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab notebook  # needed if running the notebook servers in the same environment
```

**conda** (one command installs jupyterhub and proxy):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub  # installs jupyterhub and proxy
conda install jupyterlab notebook  # needed if running the notebook servers in the same environment
```

Test your installation. If installed, these commands should return the packages'
help contents:

```bash
jupyterhub -h
configurable-http-proxy -h
```

## Start the Hub server

To start the Hub server, run the command:

```bash
jupyterhub
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and sign in with your unix
credentials.

To **allow multiple users to sign in** to the Hub server, you must start
`jupyterhub` as a _privileged user_, such as root:

```bash
sudo jupyterhub
```

The [wiki](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/wiki/Using-sudo-to-run-JupyterHub-without-root-privileges)
describes how to run the server as a _less privileged user_. This requires
additional configuration of the system.
