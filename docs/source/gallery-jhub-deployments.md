# A Gallery of JupyterHub Deployments

**A JupyterHub Community Resource**

We've compiled this list of JupyterHub deployments to help the community
see the breadth and growth of JupyterHub's use in education, research, and
high performance computing.

Please submit pull requests to update information or to add new institutions or uses.

### University of California Davis

- [Spinning up multiple Jupyter Notebooks on AWS for a tutorial](https://github.com/mblmicdiv/course2017/blob/HEAD/exercises/sourmash-setup.md)

Although not technically a JupyterHub deployment, this tutorial setup
may be helpful to others in the Jupyter community.

Thank you C. Titus Brown for sharing this with the Software Carpentry
mailing list.

```
* I started a big Amazon machine;
* I installed Docker and built a custom image containing my software of
  interest;
* I ran multiple containers, one connected to port 8000, one on 8001,
  etc. and gave each student a different port;
* students could connect in and use the Terminal program in Jupyter to
  execute commands, and could upload/download files via the Jupyter
  console interface;
* in theory I could have used notebooks too, but for this I didn’t have
  need.

I am aware that JupyterHub can probably do all of this including manage
the containers, but I’m still a bit shy of diving into that; this was
fairly straightforward, gave me disposable containers that were isolated
for each individual student, and worked almost flawlessly.  Should be
easy to do with RStudio too.
```

### Chameleon

[Chameleon](https://www.chameleoncloud.org) is a NSF-funded configurable experimental environment for large-scale computer science systems research with [bare metal reconfigurability](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/baremetal.html). Chameleon users utilize JupyterHub to document and reproduce their complex CISE and networking experiments.

- [Shared JupyterHub](https://jupyter.chameleoncloud.org): provides a common "workbench" environment for any Chameleon user.
- [Trovi](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share): a sharing portal of experiments, tutorials, and examples, which users can launch as a dedicated isolated environments on Chameleon's JupyterHub.
